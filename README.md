# Felis GNU+FFL+.../Linux Felis Package Manager
## no, i'm not serious about the naming right now.
### Goals
4th generation fpkg attempts... well, to be the 2nd fpkg, but in c, with some lua support,
and a more... mature? attempt.

the 2nd generation fpkg is in [/legacy/fpkg.py](legacy), but it shan't be treated as the current fpkg

basically, we use the library<->app model
